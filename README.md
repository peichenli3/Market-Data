I plan to write something about market data -- TAQ data (slow but cheap), ITCH data (fast but expensive), Complex Orders (confidential). One of the common features they share is that they are typically large in size (one day of Nasdaq ITCH market data can be ~ 10GB), which makes researchers hard to analyze. I will post more stuff later.This will be very interesting.  
More to come.....
